the what
========

Homebrew documentation on permissible software:

  The software in question must:

  - be maintained (e.g. upstream is still making new releases)
  - be known
  - be stable (e.g. not declared “unstable” or “beta” by upstream)
  - be used
  - have a homepage

conflates *done* with *dead*; favors software requiring maintenance
over that which *just works*.

software needs maintenance if:

- it is incomplete, or
- it builds on an unstable foundation

both can be mitigated through focus on simplicity and execution.

software like Dan Bernstein's djbdns or libtai is maintenance-free
(djbdns needed an update after its ultimate release: when gcc went
from `extern int errno` to `#include <errno.h>`).  it's not dead,
it has active users.  i'd add "and they're happy", but that's just me:
(volatile) software grumps me up.

i've been using the same email client, shell, and text editor for the
past 15 years.  neither is a paragon of maintenance-free.  i even had
to tweak my configurations twice or thrice!  mull it over: 2-3 forced
changes over 45 years of steady function.

i want stable tools with years of lifespan.  i write software for my
own use.  is it there?  getting there at least?  wrong track?
an ex-teammate reminded me: some software i did for a bank 8 years
ago still works, with no maintenance.

to be clear: there's more perishable shit than durable gems in my past.
it gets better.  i know which choices turned out wrong.

anyway.  it's doable: i've done it before.  i want more of it.

  my software for others should be good for at least ten years.
  my software for myself should be good for fifteen years or more.

lofty goals.
